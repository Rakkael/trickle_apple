When user reports 3D model loading errors or display issues
- Always check the model URL accessibility and CORS settings first
- Ensure Three.js and GLTFLoader are properly loaded before initialization
- Use unpkg.com CDN instead of cdn.jsdelivr.net for better reliability
- Implement GLTFLoader availability checks with retry mechanisms
- Wait for Three.js to be fully loaded before accessing GLTFLoader
- Add setTimeout fallbacks for GLTFLoader initialization
- Implement multiple fallback models in order of preference
- Add comprehensive error handling with retry mechanisms
- Provide clear loading status and error messages to users
- Use progressive retry delays to handle network issues
- Show network status and retry count for transparency
- Test model loading with different file formats (GLB, GLTF, OBJ)
- When user reports perspective distortion issues, adjust field-of-view (reduce to 20-35deg), increase camera distance, and use more frontal viewing angles
- When user reports see-through or transparency issues with 3D models, set material opacity to 1.0, disable transparency, use DoubleSide rendering, and add disable-transparency attribute to model-viewer
- Always update README.md when model loading logic changes
- Always update README.md when model loading logic changes
