When user reports perspective distortion in 3D model display
- Reduce field-of-view to 15-25deg (lower values create more orthographic-like view)
- Increase camera distance to minimize perspective effects
- Use more frontal viewing angles (reduce elevation angle below 70deg)
- Consider camera-orbit adjustments: horizontal rotation 15-45deg, elevation 55-70deg
- Test different camera-target positions to center the model properly
- Always update README.md when camera settings are modified for distortion fixes
